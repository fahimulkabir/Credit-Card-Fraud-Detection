# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository contains an advanced solution for detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. By analyzing anonymized transaction data from European cardholders in 2023, we developed a robust fraud detection system with exceptional performance metrics, including a near-perfect **accuracy of 99.99%** and an **AUC-ROC score of 0.999**.

The project leverages state-of-the-art algorithms and a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline to distinguish legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones. It aims to enhance financial security and assist institutions in reducing fraud-related losses.
